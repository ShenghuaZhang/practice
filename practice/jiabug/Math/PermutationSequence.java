 * https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/
 * 
 * 
 * The set [1,2,3,…,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
 * By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 * We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):
 * 
 * 1. "123"
 * 2. "132"
 * 3. "213"
 * 4. "231"
 * 5. "312"
 * 6. "321"
 * 
 * Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
 * Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
