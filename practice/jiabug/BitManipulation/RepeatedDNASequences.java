 * https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/
 * 
 * All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG".
 * When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 * 
 * Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
 * 
 * Return:["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
